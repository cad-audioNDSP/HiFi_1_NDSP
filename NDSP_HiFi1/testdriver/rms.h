/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculate relative Root-Mean-Square (RMS) power of a real 16-bit or 32-bit
signal with a full-scale sine wave used as a reference. Result is a Q8.7
value measured in dB.

NOTE
  Functions may be also used to obtain the relative RMS power of a complex
  waveform against the full-scale complex wave.

Parameters:
  Input:			
    x[N]          Real input signal
  Returned value:
                  Relative RMS power in dB, Q8.7
